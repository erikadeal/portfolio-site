      <description>&lt;p&gt;I worked with internal stakeholders to develop a modern vision of the organizationâ€™s website and brand, then overhauled the information architecture and produced a new Drupal theme in compliance with Drupal 8 coding standards. The theme is also responsive and uses Bourbon and Grunt for easier-to-navigate stylesheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous website had long since outgrown its design and was presenting serious maintenance issues to the organization. I therefore presented a plan for developing a new website to Partners for Our Children leadership, gained approval for the redesign, and managed the project timeline to completion. The process included close work with communications and graphic design staff as well as card sorts, usability testing, and stakeholder interviews with other staff in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
