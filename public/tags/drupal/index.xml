      <description>&lt;p&gt;I worked with internal stakeholders to develop a modern vision of the organizationâ€™s website and brand, then overhauled the information architecture and produced a new Drupal theme in compliance with Drupal 8 coding standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous website had long since outgrown its design and was presenting serious maintenance issues to the organization. The redesign enabled us to think about our content and web presence in ways that had previously seemed too ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
