Working with teammates specializing in content strategy and UX, I developed a WordPress theme and plugin to enable members of the organization to communicate about events and resources. Our process included user testing and design exploration.

This was an exciting project because the organization had been using an email list and in-person meetings to communicate critical information; they realized that they were missing opportunities to help people because they lacked a robust web presence. Since its launch, they have been using the website continuously.
