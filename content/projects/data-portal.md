Working with a team of 5, I overhauled the project architecture and UI of a legacy data visualization product. The project focused on making visualizations easier to use and access by reducing visual clutter on the website, creating a tag-based browse and search interface, and introducing dashboard visualizations that answer the most pressing questions we receive on a regular basis.

In addition, I developed a custom templating system that retained the original API while allowing the team to produce content in Markdown, thus solving a major content management problem for the organization.
