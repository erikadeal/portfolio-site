The Strive parenting program is a new initiative that needed a public face to garner funder and stakeholder support. Working with a communications expert, designer, and the team that developed the curriculum, I developed a custom WordPress theme and plugin. The site was designed to showcase their work and, on the back end, enable the team to receive and act on feedback as the curriculum was under development.
